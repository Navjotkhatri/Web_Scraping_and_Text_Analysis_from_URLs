# Web_Scraping_and_Text_Analysis_from_URLs
This project focuses on web scraping and text analysis from URLs using Python libraries like pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, and nltk. It extracts text, computes metrics (positive/negative scores, polarity, subjectivity, average sentence length, complex words), and saves the data to a CSV file.
